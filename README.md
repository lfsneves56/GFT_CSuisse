# Problem: Categorize trades in a bankÂ´s portfolio
# Question 1: Write a C# console application...
# Question 2: A new category was created called PEP...
#   Answer 2: 
#       Create a new IPEP contract with the signatures of the necessary methods and objects.
#       Include the IPEP inheritance in ITrade and implement the IPEP contract in the Trade class that inherits from ITrade. 
#       The source code presents this structure:
#           public interface IPEP {...}
#           public interface ITrade : IPEP {...}
#           public class Trade : ITrade {...}
